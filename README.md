JavaScript Code Quiz

This was a project involving a coding quiz that anyone can take. Right now, it is incomplete, but I plan on adding to it in the future. It allows a user to take a quiz to test their coding knowledge on JavaScript, involving a timer, and a fucntion that penalizes quiz-takers for selecting the wrong question, as well as a prompt that shows whether your answer is right or wrong. It was very challenging and hopefully I can complete it with better results at some point.
